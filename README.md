Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.

Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.

Computer Vision

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain a high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do. We can use Computer Vision to determine whether a person is affected by pneumonia or not.
Pneumonia Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

Computer Vision can be realized using Convolutional neural networks (CNN) They are neural networks making features extraction over an image before classifying it. The feature extraction performed consists of three basic operations:

    Filter an image for a particular feature (convolution)
    Detect that feature within the filtered image (using the ReLU activation)
    Condense the image to enhance the features (maximum pooling)
